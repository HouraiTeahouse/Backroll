## What's GGPO?
Traditional techniques account for network transmission time by adding delay to a players input, resulting in a sluggish, laggy game-feel.  Rollback networking uses input prediction and speculative execution to send player inputs to the game immediately, providing the illusion of a zero-latency network.  Using rollback, the same timings, reactions visual and audio queues, and muscle memory your players build up playing offline translate directly online.  The GGPO networking SDK is designed to make incorporating rollback networking into new and existing games as easy as possible.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and sample application for the Windows version of the SDK (requires Visual Studio 2019).
